 Weight Training Lingo
----------------------------------------------
 AEROBICS or AEROBIC EXERCISE: any exercise that depends largely on the oxygen from the blood to fuel the energy production in the working muscles of the body. Examples are long-term endurance activities such as running, cycling and swimming. ANAEROBIC EXERCISE: intense, short-burst exercise in which glucose and other cellular compounds energize the working muscle fibers exclusive of oxygen from the blood. Examples are weight lifting and sprinting. BARBELL or BB: the main and basic implement of weight lifting (along with dumbbells) composed of a length of steel bar affixed with circular weights of differing denominations (plates) on both ends. Typical barbells are approximately one inch to one-and-an-eighth inches in diameter and five to seven feet long. BICEPS or B Is: the muscles located on the front of the upper arm primarily engaged in bending the elbow. They pull and curl. BODYBUILDING: the competitive sport or athletic hobby popularized over the last 60 years of the last century whose goal is to achieve muscular grandeur and symmetry through the activity of exercise (a.k.a. muscle building). The foremost activities to achieve bodybuilding perfection are weight lifting and resistance training through the application of a wide variety of gym equipment, cables and machines. Nutrition plays a major role in bodybuilding achievement. BODYPART: referring to the individual muscle groups. Workouts are often split into different bodyparts on different days, however many trainees do all-body workouts. Other types of training, such as Olympic lifting or strongman training do not make any bodypart distinction in reference to the routines. BURN: the sensation of burning pain felt in the specific muscle or muscles under the intense contraction of resistance training. This reaction is due to the presence of lactic acid in the tissues, a byproduct of glucose metabolism during intense exercise. The burn, though painful, is welcomed by the trainee as the degree of burn endured indicates the level of muscle overload achieved, a key factor in muscle building. The burn is good, more is better. CARDIO: pertaining to the heart. Exercise jargon for any effective aerobic activity. CONCENTRIC CONTRACTION: the shortening of a muscle due to muscle contraction. Also known as the positive or positive contraction, moving the resistance away from the plane of gravity. For example, pulling the weight up in a biceps curl movement. DELTOIDS or DELTS: the large, three-part muscles (front, side and rear deltoid) of the shoulder that move the arms away from the body. They push and press. DOMS: recently popularized acronym for Delayed Onset Muscular Soreness, the phenomena of muscle soreness from sport or exercise afflicting the body a day or two after performance. Causes and desirability are subject to discussion. DUMBBELLS or D Bs: the short-handled partners of the barbell that complete the core of the weight lifting family. Dumbbells usually come in matching pairs and will range in length from six to eight inches (light D Bs allowing for handgrip and a minimum of affixed plates) to 24 inches (heavy duty). ECCENTRIC CONTRACTION: the lengthening of the muscle while under the tension of resistance. Also known as the negative or negative contraction, countering the resistance in its movement toward the gravity plane. For example, the lowering of the weight in a biceps curl. EXTENSION: the straightening of a simple joint, as in the leg extension. EXERCISE: the activity of fitness, however in our context this generally refers to a specific movement. EZ CURL BAR or BENT BAR: a specially bent barbell to accommodate the handgrip, affording lifting and muscle-building advantages in both biceps curling and triceps extension exercises. Hand angles often protect wrists and elbows from abusive twist. FLOW: a training term referring to the smooth and continuous movement from exercise to exercise without interruption in focus and action. FOCUS: concentration on all the aspects of the work before you: muscles involved, the track they follow, the intensity of exertion, burn and pump, and signals of fatigue, injury or abuse. Concentration is extended to the weight used, technique applied, attitude, thirst, surrounding atmosphere, equipment and so on. Full-time job of primary importance. FULL RANGE OF MOTION: a reference to the total action of a muscle(s) and the associated joint(s) in contrast to partial or abbreviated muscle and joint action. GETTING CUT: bodybuilding term for gaining muscularity through serious application of training; exercise and diet without faltering. GETTING RIPPED: bodybuilding slang for extreme muscularizing; gaining superior muscle hardness and definition through hard weight training and severe dieting. GLUTEUS MAXIMUS: glutes, butt, bottom, rear. The outermost muscle of the three glutei found in each of the human buttocks. GRIP: the ability to apply continuous pressure with the hands and fingers. Better grip enhances strength in most cases. HAMSTRINGS or HAMS: a.k.a the thigh biceps. Short for hamstring muscle, any of three muscles at the back of the thigh that function to flex and rotate the leg and extend the thigh. HIGH REPS: terminology for a technique in muscle building where high repetitions (safe estimation: above 12) of given exercises are performed for specific purposes (exercise practice, muscle warm-up, injury repair, muscularity, sport conditioning, weight loss). HIT: high-intensity training, a training technique where the trainee applies his training output to failure (extreme, maximum, total, dizzy, falling down！nausea is a good sign of the last rep) during each set after appropriately warming up. HIT workouts are typically shorter in duration and less frequent than other methods of training. INTENSITY: extremity of strength, force, energy and feeling directed toward one¨s training. Combine with focus. ISOLATION: a reference to exercising one specific muscle exclusive of others to focus effort on or protect that muscle. KETTLEBELLS: not new, but new to the modern lifting scene, these are small-to-large cast-iron globes with a handle. Simple, yet effective and worth consideration for home trainees. LACTIC ACID: a byproduct of glucose and glycogen metabolism produced in the muscles during the hard work of exercise. Its presence is accompanied by muscle fatigue and burning pain. Embrace the pain and grow lean. LATISSIMUS DORSI or LATS: the large muscles of the back that are chiefly responsible for the V-shape noticed in the male and female form. The lats are the prime movers for the adduction, extension and hyperextension of the shoulder joints. They pull; the shoulders push. LOW REPS: the system of practicing low repetitions (below six) for specific effects in training (muscle mass, bulk, weight gain, power). MAX REP or SINGLES: a reference in powerlifting to the heavy single repetition sets (single rep set) practiced in training to approach one¨s maximum (max) lifting output. 1RM= one rep max. MULTI-SET: a series of exercises (usually 4 or 5) performed one after another with little pause. The total comprises one multi-set of perhaps 3, 4 or 5 multi-sets, the trainee in pursuit of specific goals (peak athletic conditioning, muscularity, aerobics, change of pace). OLYMPIC BAR and PLATES: the popular weights used in competition and training. The standard bar weighs 45 pounds and is approximately seven feet long with rotating sleeves for lifting efficiency. Handsome tools. OLYMPIC LIFTING: the weight-lifting sport of the Olympics, requiring enormous strength and extraordinary skill and athletics. It includes two lifts: the clean and jerk, and the snatch. PACE: in weight lifting, as in other sports, a training term referring to the gauged speed at which one trains. Pace will vary with personality, purpose, mood or external factors (gym busy-ness, injury, other revolting interruptions). PECTORALS or PECS: the broad band of muscles across the chest thats prime function is abducting the arms！moving the arms across the chest. PERSONAL TRAINER: a private instructor to teach, assist and encourage a trainee of any sport at any level. Personal fitness instructors play an important role in the lives of many struggling and aspiring health- and condition-conscious people. POWERLIFTING: the popular competitive sport of heavy weight lifting, which features the three power lifts: the bench press, the squat and the deadlift. PR: abbreviation for personal record. PUMP: muscle jargon referring to the enlarged and tightened sensation the lifter experiences within the working muscle resulting from the blood engorgement. PUMPING IRON: originating in the ¨50s, slang for lifting weights. QUADRICEPS or QUADS: the major four-part muscles of the front thighs primarily engaged in extending the leg at the knee. REPETITION or REP: one complete movement of an exercise. RHYTHM: a term an athlete uses to describe the sensation of flow and pace in his sport performance. The weight trainer¨s rhythm of training is achieved when functions are efficient and unimpeded. ROTATOR CUFF: the complex of supporting and strengthening tendons and muscles that combine with the shoulder joint where the capsule of the shoulder and the head of the humerus (long bone of the upper arm) meet. A problem area for most active people, especially power athletes. Don't forget to stretch your pectoral muscles regularly. SANDBAGS: light-to-heavy dufflebags used to heft and carry for strength and endurance. SERRATUS: the triple-tiered ridge of muscle located below the pecs and forward of the lats that accommodates the lats in adduction movement. SET: the prescribed number of repetitions of any given exercise. Example: 1 set of 8 repetitions. SINGLE-SET TRAINING: a system of training among strength lifters where sets of single repetitions are practiced with near-maximum output to develop skill, tenacity, structure strength and muscle power. SLED PULLING: the act of pulling an implement over distance using various angles and positions for endurance work. SMITH PRESS: a training apparatus that houses a bar that is smoothly guided by precision rods and bearings, allowing the trainee to press with unique and purposeful advantage, although there's disagreement on the safety of this machine. Typically, plates are loaded as they are on free bars. SPECIALTY BARS and HANDLES: some of the most effective pieces of equipment in the home or commercial gym are the assortment of various shaped bars and handles that effect and encourage hard training. They include the Buffalo bar or top squat for comfortable squat performance, the trap bar for back and leg building. Handles for attachment to the cable devices come in a variety of lengths and bends and are made of steel, rope, leather or cloth. The right handles or bar for the right exercise or muscle development makes training fun and effective. SPLIT WORKOUT: a workout divided into two or more bodyparts thereby allowing different muscle groups to be worked on different days. SPOT: the act of standing nearby in a supportive capacity as a co-lifter attempts heavy lifting where assistance might be required. The spot might include assistance in the case of failure to complete a lift, aid in bringing a heavy weight into starting position or added lifting help for an intense trainee forcing repetitions beyond his own limits. SPOTTER: one who spots. STONE LIFTING: from the ground to shoulder-height or overhead, these are usually heavy round cement balls used to train for or compete in strongman competitions. STRONGMAN EVENTS: relatively new on the scene as a regulated event, these competitions feature men and women who pit their overall strength and endurance against one another. There are many different feats of strength, and different promoters use different implements depending on the venue. SUPERSET: two exercises performed alternately; one exercise followed by a second exercise in complement before resting, i.e. biceps curl followed by triceps extension equal one superset. SUPPLEMENTS: "supplemental" vitamin or protein intake, used in addition to enhance regular food intake. TENDINITIS: inflammation of a tendon, the tough band of connective tissue that connects a muscle to the bone. The affliction is common among athletes who strive hard or overtrain or allow themselves to get out of condition on occasion. Tendons, unfortunately, take a long time to heal. Ice often. TORSO: the reference to the trunk and midsection muscles: abdominals, obliques, erectors, intercostals. TRAINING LOG: a book for recording training procedures and progress, exercises, sets, repetitions and weights used. Notations of observations, feelings and training responses often prove valuable at the moment of logging or in the future when comparisons and references guide the way. TRICEPS or TR Is: the muscles on the back of the upper arm primarily for extending the elbow. They push or press. TRI-SETS: three exercises executed one after the other in close succession, the total comprising one set, or tri-set. VOLUME: a reference in muscle building to the total of sets and reps of exercises completed in a workout. VOLUME TRAINING: the name of the technique where high volume is used. WORKOUT: the noun; the sum total of one¨s time, collection of exercises performed and the energy burned on the gym floor, be it at the local gym or in your garage. WORKING IN: the practice of cooperatively working with someone using a particular piece of equipment on the gym floor.

 Six Keys to Successful Bodybuilding
----------------------------------------------
 These are nothing new and read like the same stuff in any motivational book on the market today. Yet they offer valuable insight and are essential to getting started and sticking to it.    Set a realistic goal - short and long term.    Plan an orderly and thorough routine to train the entire body.    Make a commitment to stick to your routine for 4-5 weeks - - to begin to see changes and benefits, develop perseverance and create a habit.    Enthusiasm for training must be recognized as the main and driving force to perform successfully.    Ease into a training program with a wholesome, thoughtful nutritional plan - proper food, order and amount of consumption.    Be confident from the beginning that the application of these sound principles will produce the desired results. In this article, Dave breaks down these simple suggestions. As we look back, we see the things we did right, and the things we did wrong. The IOL forum offers these suggestions for getting started off right in your fitness program. Here you'll find the answers to questions most beginners ask about starting a weight training program. Working out at home and with limited equipment? Byron suggests you can get a workout from anything that's around. Here are his ideas of items you might be able to use. Even with all the equipment in the world available, it's good to have these things in your repertoire.    Learn a lot of bodyweight exercises, be creative with variations. Make a sandbag or two.    Buy or make a chinup bar, it's good for more than just chins; if you're lucky, you'll find something you can use around the house, in the yard, or at a playground. But a doorway chin bar is awfully useful for $15-$20.    Hang a pair of chains with handles from the chinup bar, you can do a lot of exercises with these. You can also use a good rope and a couple pipes rather than chain and handles.    Get a couple surgical tubing exercisers, these are just a length of tubing with a handle at either end. Make a sled to drag.    Do some stair climbing.    If you only have a small amount of plates for dumbbells, load it all up on one dumbbell and do one handed exercises. This discussion will give you some ideas of a prime home-gym setup.

 And now for a sample workout from Wicked Willie
----------------------------------------------
 You want to initially choose movements that will engage as much of your muscle mass at once (compound movements) so that your workouts will be efficient.  You also want to get the most "bang for your buck," so to speak.  You want your workout to be simple, short and hard enough to stimulate growth. Don't worry too much right now about direct movements for your abdominals...just get into the workout habit, by not missing a workout for three months, if you can manage that.  Concentrate on building muscle and the fat will be used for energy and replaced by muscle (provided your diet allows this...and it looked good.) Here's a thought on the workout...see how you like it.  Requires a minimum of equipment and time. Warm up - 15 minutes of walking, while swinging your arms around in various ways.  Call it GONZO power walking.  You should break a light sweat.  Or you can use a stationary bike...the idea is to heat up your core temperature and stimulate overall circulation and synovial fluid in the joints Squat 3x10 to at least parallel depth. When you can do 3x12 in good form...increase the weight.  If you can't squat with weight, do them without weights.  If for some reason, you are mechanically unable to squat...you may substitute the leg press.  But seriously work at the squat before giving up...it is that important. Overhead Press 4x6 When you can do 4x8 in good form, increase. Dumbbell Row  4x8 When you can do 4x10...  You may occasionally substitute the Lat Pulldown, your choice of grip and grip width. Deadlift 6x4 Reset for each rep...DO NOT use a touch and go style.  Do these moderately for back integrity...don't push hard on them until you've lost some weight and gained conditioning. Cool down 5-10 minutes of walking or stationary bike at a slower pace. That's your workout blueprint...it shouldn't take more than 45 minutes, minus the warm up.  Once a week, just to satisfy your ego and desire...add some curls and triceps pushdowns or some type of curl and tricep work.  THIS IS OPTIONAL...the basic blueprint is NOT OPTIONAL.  Do this moderately also, just for pump and a good feeling. Once you've lost some weight and gained some conditioning, you can add isolation type stuff if you wish...but if you use the basics outlined here, you won't really need to use them.  It's better to leave a workout feeling you could have done more, than it is to leave exhausted.  Train, don't strain. Wicked

 Let's look to Byron to discover which of the following statements are true: 1) To get bigger you must get stronger or 2) Strength and size are totally unrelated. In this forum thread on building muscle size and strength, Byron writes: Hatfield had it right all those years ago when he broke down hypertrophy into it's individual components.  He explained how you could increase the size of the fibers, the fluid around the fibers, and the capillaries that supply the fibers. Capillarization is really something more prone to happen in the extreme endurance athlete.  Since that training is generally incompatible with training for size and strength, I think it's safe to say it's not that useful. Increasing the fluid (sacroplasmic hypertrophy) happens faster than the others, but it seems to top off plateau pretty early on.  The training for this doesn't do all that much to increase fiber size. Thickening the fibers is most effectively done by getting stronger.  "Stronger" is tricky though.  In the strictest sense, this is just an increase in the amount of force with which the muscle can contract. A muscle can get stronger via growth (more contractile protein) or by an increase in recruitment (the ability of the nervous system to fire the fibers). You can get stronger at a lift by making the involved muscles stronger, or by improving your skill.  (This is not the same as recruitment.) When you first start training for strength, the neurological gains typically occur rapidly then plateau. Over time, the thing with the most potential for growth is the thickening of the fibers. If you always train for hypertrophy, that is, growth of a comibination of all factors, you'll probably never gain all the strength you could - unless you're a mutant or on steroids or both. If you train for strength for a short while, you are going to make some neurological changes while some of the size-without-strength factors drop off.  This is what I think happened to you. If you continue to train for strength, your neurological gains are going to top off before long and your gains are going to come from thickening the fibers, size.  (If your neurological gains don't top off soon, you're going to have to settle for a gold medal in weightlifting or a poewerlifting world record.  Boo Hoo.) If you ever want to bring your hypertrophy to a peak for some event, say for a bodybuilding comp, in the short term (3-4 months) you'd naturally change your training to maximize those factors.  But long term, you'd have to go back to gaining strength to ultimately beat that peak. Anyway, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.  It's all based in science.  You see a lot of people that have no taste for the laws of men or science.  But, you don't see nearly as many breakingbreaking the laws of science.

 This one's a biggie, isn't it? In our niche, it's surely the biggest argument, except maybe who should have won the 1980 Olympia, and causes more than a little bit of animosity. Do you have a good link to share that fairly compares these two training styles? Let's do our part to better explain this issue. To begin your education, you need to know what HIT is, and what it isn't. Steve Wedan's ready to educate you in this HIT primer, complete with a who's who of early HIT history.

 Ever wonder why powerlifters have big, er, girths? You think that's fat? Not so, not even. Since powerlifting is a low-population sport, it's likely you've never been around powerlifters in training. They don't train in fitness clubs; you won't see any powerlifting at Bally's. Take a look under the surface of this Men's Health article by Stephen Perrine on extreme powerlifting lifestyles. Great stuff there.  Another article on the lighter side of powerlifting:  27 Reasons To Be Big Visit Powerlifting Watch for links to all the powerlifting federations, upcoming meets, popular powerlifting forums competitive gyms by state and more. Don't forget to check out the Westside Methods Section:    Westside Methods How do I wrap my knees? (video)    How do I get into my squat suit?    How do I get into my shirt? You'll find a forum full of powerlifting events scheduled here. Plus maybe find someone to help you get on that bench shirt once you get there. If you decide to compete, Rickey Dale Crain has some meet pointers to help you prepare, as does Roger Broeg, here. All those federations and rules got you tied in knots? This powerlifting federation comparison chart will help you select the group that's right for you. Rickey's got a beefy article on advanced powerlifting techniques, here, and Eric Stone offers this one on cycling your training. The numerous powerlifting routines Rickey used throughout the years is examined here. American Powerlift Evolution is a who's who in the history of powerlifting, 1900-1985, and a great site for all iron history enthusiasts. Want some pointers or some camaraderie? Here's an active, enthusiastic powerlifting forum where you'll be welcomed and then educated. Fred Hatfield, aka Dr. Squat, outlines his powerlifting conditioning program, a 12-week conditioning and peaking cycle. Curious? This is the video clip of Dr. Squat's world record squat, 1,014 pounds.

 Click HERE to download a spreadsheet that maps out a 5x5 program.  It takes you from initial testing through re-testing;  the results at the end can be plugged in to the beginning and you can re-run the program. Some notes: The spreadsheet was created in Microsoft Excel.  If you don't have Excel, you can download free compatible programs such as Gnumeric (only 16MB to download) or Open Office (much larger but includes a lot of other software) to use it.  Update:  you can also use Google Documents to open and work on the spreadsheet - this is the preferred method if you want to let someone take a look at your spreadsheet, and probably the easiest way to go in any case, if you don't already have a spreadsheet program.    This program uses what's called "Dual Factor Periodization."  In this instance it is a fairly straightforward application.  You work 5x5 progressively harder each week for four weeks;  then you take a light week;  then you work 3x3 progressively harder for another four weeks.    Beginners should not use this type of system, since they are capable of constant gradual increases - using this program will be too easy for them.  This may seem counterintuitive;  think of it this way:  a beginner is not capable of generating adequate effort to make this routine work. Beginners CAN use the same exercises, with a simpler progression scheme.  This should be done until gains plateau.    The plan is based on your current rep maxes.  Not what you did a year ago at the end of the summer, not what you think you could do on a good day, not what you figure you'll be able to do in a week;  what you can do now.  You test yourself to see what your current maxes are before beginning the program and plug in the numbers.  Guessing your maxes wrong, and especially overestimating or fudging, will lead to disappointing results.    If you are in a situation where your current strength level is off - for example, if you are just coming back after a layoff - it's better to do some preliminary training.  This will get your maxes up to a more realistic representation of your strength.  In more formal terms, don't jump right into dual factor periodization right after a layoff.  Use a simple linear plan, one where your workouts get progressively heavier until your progress plateaus - probably at a level at or near where you were before the layoff.  That is, train like a beginner until you plateau.    The program involves two workouts per week for the core lifts.  One workout the same poundage is used for every work set;  the other uses progressively heavier weight each set.  This is know as the Texas Method.    Where 1x5 is called for, you want to do some light warmup sets then do five progressively heavier sets of five working up to the target weight.  Only the set with target weight should be taxing.  In the harder weeks, you may not get all five reps, just do your best, maintaining good form.  Weights for the ramp up sets are listed in the spreadsheet but they aren't carved in stone, just guidelines / suggestions.    Where 5x5 is called for, do some light warmup sets then do five sets of five with the target weight.  In the heavier weeks, you may not get all five reps in all five sets - again, just do your best.    Same instructions where 1x3 or 3x3 are called for.    The first four weeks get progressively harder;  in the fifth week, you drop back;  in the sixth through ninth weeks, you build up to another peak; in the tenth week, you rest again, and in the eleventh, you retest.    Substituting exercises may be okay, e.g., dumbbell bench presses for bench presses, stifflegged deadlifts for deadlifts, etc.  However, coaches very experienced with the program have observed that this is the number one place where people foul up.  Try to resist the temptation to tweak, and for Pete's sake, don't even think about substituting leg presses for squats. If you aren't strong enough to do 5x5 in the Chin yet, you can use some lightened method such as using a Jump Stretch band for assistance.  It should be fine to substitute pulldowns.  I suggest not using the pads that hold down your legs;  in my opinion, those are for doing pulldowns with more than bodyweight, not less.  They make it very tempting to add a little heaving with a lean-back.  Pulldowns may not be the very best way to get to doing chins, but they fit fine in the rest of the template.  This is not a chinup program, this is an overall strength program.    The "PR" in the spreadsheet stands for "P Ress" - plain old standing press. If you are working with weights around 100 pounds or lower, rounding everything to the nearest five pound increment may not work well.  If so, use smaller plates for finer adjustment of the poundages. Extensive additional information on this program and training in general is available here.  Can't recommend it highly enough. The most thorough resource available on this subject is Aasgaard Publishing.  The books Starting Strength and Practical Programming will give you all the needed background to work these programs to the best of your best abilities. NOTE: There is now a 5x5 section on the IOL Forum  For questions, comments, and discussion on this and other 5x5 programs. Here is the old version of the spreadsheet, just for archival purposes.

  Even if you have no desire to lift in a strongman contest or train for heavy events, you owe it to yourself to spend a day at a strongman contest, sharing time with some of the finest folks in the iron game. You'll have fun reading this strongman event overview. For new strongman enthusiasts, take a read of this strongman competitor training program overview. In this article Tom Incledon describes the action of tire flipping and outlines a training program to get you started. I quote Tom, "We¨ve all seen then on TV. Most of the time it¨s at 2AM and we¨re channel surfing, when all of a sudden, there he is. Some big behemoth of a man is flipping a tire that dwarfs his huge size. In the background you see another guy that can¨t even lift the tire. How is it that one guy can lift a tire so easily and another can¨t even budge it? If you think it¨s simply because one guy is stronger than the other, then guess again. No matter how strong you are, if your technique is poor, then flipping a tire will be difficult to impossible. If you want to impress your friends, get strong, and learn how to do one of the classic strongman events, then this is your article." In this youtube video Smitty demonstrates how to flip a tire. If you've never seen a strongman competition, this link will open a video window and show you the Tampa Bay Strongman Competition. To begin your strongman training, here are two articles from EliteFTS to consider: Strongman Training for Athletic Strength A Beginner's Guide to Strongman Training    Strongman Training for Athletic Strength    A Beginner's Guide to Strongman Training Michelle pointed us to this guy for some strongman equipment, good prices, equipment and service.

  You'll find a general grip overview over at wikipedia. In this IOL thread, Clay Edgin describes how to rip a phone book, then answer questions on the technique. Here he tells how to Train with grippers. Over at Functional Hand Strength you'll find a bunch of articles on hand and grip strength, and a grip newsletter. IronMind is one great place to start for grippers and grip info. John Brookfield has a new grip tip column over at IronMind that will surely get you motivated by aching hands -- and quick progress. There's an active grip board forumover at Cyberpump -- you have to register to see it, but I'll tell you upfront, the bosses of grip strength await you once you log in. There are a couple of popular gripper certifications the guys are chomping at. The most well known is Captain's of Crush over at Iron Mind, where they also sell these outstanding grippers. Another cert is Mash Monster Elite, which is coming up strong. Grippers are also made by Heavy Sports -- here's a link to one of Clay's articles on tearing cards on their site, where you'll find the grippers. They're cheaper than the Iron Mind grippers, and reports are to expect slightly less quality. Perfect for some of us, not for others. In the Doctor Ken photo gallery here on Iron Online, you'll find my favorite gripping and ripping photos. In this article at naturalstrength.com, David Gentle writes of someamazing feats of grip strength. UK grip man Steve Gardener discusses grip training techniques in this Dolfzine article. Matt Cannon lives near grip pioneer Warren Tetting and reports the following comments after meeting with him. Warren TettingI met Warren at his shop yesterday and it was certainly an experience. He loves to talk training and the "good-ole-days." He's really not impressed with current state of sports, especially the strength sports. So, I got an education about the Golden Era. He speaks so passionately about these times, it's understandable why he would be nostalgic. GrippersWe spent quite a bit of time talking grippers. I brought my CoC1, CoC2, and Heavy Gripper HG 300 just for kicks. He took a quick look at the HG 300 and was appalled by the construction. The spring is huge, .295, same as a BBE! However, the handles are mounted at least 1/4" from the spring, making it much easier. My HG 300 is barely harder than a Co C 2, and definitely easier than a BBSM. If the handles were mounted properly, it would be harder than a 3! He was also surprised to see my Co C 1. He had not seen the polished GR 8 springs. Also, the spring is .245 which is heavier than before. Co C 1 used to be a .235 spring. So, Ironmind has quietly made the Co C 1 harder, probably to make room for the T, G, and S. We talked about Ironmind and Strossen for a while, but I was confused by the history and didn't really follow. Big Grippers"Warren, why the hell do you make these?" That was my question upon picking up some Super-Nova-Galaxy-Evil-Gripper thing. It was whichever gripper is the hardest one he makes. The spring looked like brains. My best effort on the gripper, with both hands, yielded no movement. "Did you say you have a BBA around here somewhere?" Apparently, some benders buy the huge grippers to practice the two-handed crush at the end of a bend. They can have them. (If you're not familiar, Warren's hardest gripper is about 3 times as hard as an Ironmind Co C 4. Three times as hard...) HandsWarren grabbed my hand and says, "Lemme see here." He had me touch the middle of my palm with my thumb so he could poke my thumb pad. "Is that as hard as you can make it?" Sorry, Warren, that's it! So, my thumb pad has a long way to come. He also said my hand needs to get thicker in the palm overall. He recommended telegraph key. Telegraph KeyI ended up buying one of these from Warren. He reiterated, "There is no substitute for building the thumb pad." Sounds like a deal. We went through how to use the thing, and it's pretty straight-forward. With the machine about waist height, hook the fingers under the bottom key and the thumb on the top key. Close your hand. It's not the presidential-hand-gesture-grip like I thought. Your fingers should be a supinated hook grip. I noticed while using the machine that my thumb would bend at the bottom of the rep. Warren said that's fine, just make sure your thumb is doing the work. Other trainingWarren recommended squats squats and squats. Specifically 20 rep squats, twice a week if possible. Also, forearm work like wrist curls and hammer curls. Never on grip days, though. Telegraph Key twice a week. Get rid of bench press and do reverse dips instead. Warren does not have a website, but you can reach him by phone or snail mail at: Warren Tetting, C/O Thor Strength, 1063 W. 7th St., St. Paul, MN 55102. Phone: (651)-222-1889.    This is "dogleg" of the gripper.    Note: This photo is missing from the server To clarify the picture, its the front and back of the same gripper. The straight leg is the dogleg. This is a confusing part of gripper anatomy that beginners have a hard time identifying. The "dogleg" is the straight leg of the gripper in the picture. It's a byproduct of how the spring is wound. There is a consensus that the dogleg should be in your palm when closing the gripper in your right hand. The straight leg is the better leg for bracing the gripper, in other words. For the left hand, opinions differ. Some say the dogleg should still be in your palm for maximum bracing. However, if you look closely, this reverses the direction the spring is wound. Because of this, some say the dogleg should be in your fingers on the left hand in order to create a similar experience as the right. Either way, I personally haven't noticed much of a difference. ~Matt Byron describes how to make your own wrist roller in this blog post.

Sportsmans Guide has some great deals on duffel bags; that Germany Navy duffel looks real good. Byron wrote that he'd been using "barracks bags" from the local army-navy, but found out the hard way you have to double them up. Or just follow Wicked Willie's frugal tips: Secure a number of heavy duty plastic lawn bags. Using a double or triple bag, fill it with sand till it weighs 50 lbs. Make of several of these bags, closing them with the Universal Tool - duct tape. Then enclose them in a surplus duffle bag. Shoulder and carry for distance. Bearhug and carry for distance. You'll be huffing and puffing in no time.  (50 lbs. is just a suggestion, I recommend that you make a variety of sizes - 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 lbs.  This allows for easier "progressive resistance.") If you're feeling flush, IronMind has a sandbag kit or you can buy an Everlast heavy bag, and the bodybags over at k2fitness are choice. Newer on the scene are Josh Henkin's sandbags with add-on inserts, (seen above)... very popular. He's got a dvd with 60 sandbag exercises demonstrated, too, which you'll also find at that link.

 Might as well cut right to the chase.  Stephen Seiler's site is not an easy introduction to the topic;  it gets into the physiological brass tacks at the heart of the matter. We carried on quite a conversation about cardio fitness a while back. Once you glean through that, you'll be all set because we discussed: how much cardio? HIIT, High Intensity Interval Cardio Training, Interval Cardio Sample Workouts, Pushing Cars for Cardio Work, Stair Climbing for Lean Legs, Indoor "Spin" Cycle Training, Jogging and Sprint Training, Outdoor Cycling and Cardio on an Empty Stomach? And we followed that up with a meaty discussion on HIIT (interval training), with examples of intervals, heart rate monitor use and sample training methods, and Byron answers more Tabata questions here. The most talked-about interval cardio workout is what's known as the Tabata Protocol, in its simplest form: 6-8 20-second very hard intervals with 10-second rest periods. From The Tempus Clinic we get this Tabata Protocol description. Men's Fitness offers this article detailing the Tabata Protocol. This link takes you to the actual research studies comparing the Tabata, Tremblay and Girandola studies. Here we find the Ripped Clarence Bass discussing interval cardio in Forget the Fat-Burn Zone. In this article, Clarence considers Richard Winett's switch from the Tabata Protocol to GXP (Graded Exercise Protocol). And let's ask Dr. Winett to help you sort out your workout combinations: cardio vs resistance training. This page will describe the best way to train the cardiovascular system -- with a heart rate monitor -- and gives an overview. And this page from Cycle Performance Tips gives more detail into heart rate training. The late coach Pat O'Shea used interval training for his training, and that of his athletes. Cyclists will improve greatly by using his anaerobic training approach. Again from Cycle Performance, let's take a closer look at interval training and how to put this together into a weekly training program. Want more? The book Precision Heart Rate Training by Edmund Burke is your next step. Jay Blahnik is the best spin/cycle interval training video instructor, as you'll discover in this precision heart rate training video. Sally Edwards tells us how to get started with heart rate monitor training. And drop on over to the Crossfit & GPP section here in the wiki for more on cardio fitness. Over on PubMed you'll find three reports of interest: Impact of high-intensity exercise on energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and body fatness; Impact of exercise intensity on body fatness and skeletal muscle metabolism; and Metabolic profile of high intensity intermittent exercises. These will give you the research documentation of pretty much everything discussed above. * Here's a real good article by John Christy regarding how to incorporate conditioning into your overall strength/size training plan.

 To start this off, consider the following
----------------------------------------------
 I am just this year completing 30 years service with the police department. About fifteen years ago, I developed a physical testing program for police recruits that is still being used by my department. At that time, many of the physical tests being used by police agencies were being challenged in court as not representative of those tasks that might occur in an officer¨s daily work environment. Our test was/is designed to test upper body strength and general fitness of police recruits. The lieutenant continues: The testing involves running approximately 660 yards on a combination dirt pathway and grass with a gradual incline. Along the way, prospective recruits must climb over two ten-foot chain link fences, traverse a ten-inch-wide balance beam, negotiate two sets of over-and-under barricades and finally, climb over a six-foot cinder block wall at the end of the course.The course must be completed in four minutes or less. This test has never been challenged and is truly representative of things an officer might encounter during a foot pursuit. If a recruit is generally fit, he/she can complete the course in sufficient time. Most of those who fail do so because of poor upper body strength and are usually carrying extra body fat.

 Fire Captain Dan Martin suggests the following workout to prepare for the physical agility test
----------------------------------------------
 Press, either with barbell or dumbbells Squat, high reps  Pull from the floor, either the dead lift or high pull  Pull-up, high reps  Farmer's Walk Other exercises: dips, kettlebell snatch, wrist curl, hill sprints, car push, neck work

 And adds
----------------------------------------------
 If preparing for an entry level test, find out if it is a CPAT, which stands for Candidate Physical Ability test. I think it's a rather fair test. The candidate will wear a 50-pound vest for the whole test, but, to get things rolling, the'll wear an additional 25-pound vest while warming up for 3 minutes on a stairstep treadmill (looks like an escalator). Then they will do various job simulations. If I were taking a CPAT, I'd do a lot of sledge hammer work. Pound sand, a log, whatever, to get used to the efforts, and give myself enough time to benefit from the conditioning. Also, I would consider doing Burpees (eight-count push-ups) and maybe Tabata style "thrusters." Strength is important, so is the abilty to sustain. Most candidates fail to understand that conditioning is key. If they have enough time, consider this: Work towards being able to jog 3 miles most every day.  Kettlebell circuits are your friend. For example: Thrusters/Snatch/Farmer's Walk Pull-ups save lives.  Hill sprints hurt so good. Maybe have a sandbag that you can press at the bottom of the hill, and a kettlebell you can snatch at the top of the hill. All very doable, they have to want it. Here's a firefighter fitness thread.    Weight Vests Note: in the selection of weight vests, there is one that you add your own weights to. The pockets are set up to handle two 2.5-pound plates each. That would give you a very durable 40-pound vest with a tremendous shipping savings.    Kettlebell info    Sandbag info    Tabata explained

 In addition, from Bruce

 In two of the firefighter tests I practiced up here in Washington we had to run up and down 5 flights of stairs with a 50-lb hose on our shoulder in under 78 seconds. One other thing was to drag a 100-lb tire that simulated a charged hose 100 feet in one direction and then turn around and go the other way for 100 feet in approximate 40 seconds. Dragging a sled would be good for that one if you have the rope over your shoulder. For the stair climb I did step ups with twice the weight of the hose; in addition the running up and down the stairs in my house with a 55-lb dumbbell on my shoulder. I counted the stairs and how high they were and added extra reps and height so I would be working harder on the step-ups. These are just additions to the good advice from Dan. And now, go over to the firefighters' resource page at Strengthcats.com. At EliteFTS, you'll learn of the Seven Strength and Conditioning Tools for Firefighters.

Crossfit website. Wicked wrote up an awfully good description of sled pulling (everything Wicked writes is awfully good), and it generated a lengthy conversation with good insight... how to make your own sled, where to pull, that type of thing. From Iron Mind, take a look at their pulling harness -- the official harness used at the World's Strongest Man contest. And maybe a sandbag might sit well next to your back door. Byron posted a link to Louie Simmons' site, with this note on sled dragging, "By the way, for anyone sled shopping, Louie Simmons is selling a sled for a little less, $119 instead of $155, at Westside Barbell's web site. Elitefts is great but Louie deserves some credit, it was Louie that really got people started dragging sleds." Here's the link to the Westside equipment page; scroll down a ways to get to the sled. Here's a real good article by John Christy regarding how to incorporate conditioning into your overall strength/size training plan.

 Torque Athletic makes Dave Draper's  thick bars and handles, the  Draper Dungeon power rack, the Top Squat, and  a lot of other eclectic equipment. IronMind makes and sells a great deal of lifting gear, including the  Captains of Crush hand grippers and a lot of other grip-training equipment. Iron Mind also publishes the (in)famous  Super Squats book and the excellent MILO quarterly journal. Fractional Plates,AKA microloading, piling on the small plates adds up to big gains. PDA's plates are nifty, but what if you're watching your wallet? Here, let's make our own micro weights. Thick bars spread the weight's pressure over a larger surface of your hand, easing the workload on the joints while at the same time working your grip. These are Dave's thick-bar pulley handles for cable work. Michelle pointed us to this guy for some strongman equipment, good prices, equipment and service. He has logs, farmers handles, a sled and yoke that he builds and I'd venture to guess that he'd probably be able to weld something you were interested in together: Alan Benninga: pitbullk9@yahoo.com Stones, big stones and more. Roger's built a collection of the best in retro training here at Atomic Athletic.

 Axle Mounted Wrist Roller
----------------------------------------------
 The good old "wrist roller" was a good tool for thickening the forearms and strengthening the wrists.  It's construction was simplicity itself - take an 18 inch piece of old broomstick or wood dowel.  Drill a hole in the center of it and pass a rope knotted on one through the hole.  Tie the other end around some barbell plates.  Hold the stick at arm's length or let it hang down.  Now, roll the weight up and down.  Simple, cheap and effective. This modification takes that idea one step further. If you have a power rack or some similar type of device to hold a horizontal bar, you can easily construct an axle mounted version of the wrist roller.  (You could use squat stands and your barbell bar with revolving sleeve, for instance.)

 Materials Required
----------------------------------------------
 Sufficient thick wall PVC tubing to span the uprights of your power rack.  (Mine is 24 inches wide in between the uprights, so I used a piece of 1 1/2 inch diameter PVC tubing.)  It needs to have a large enough inside diameter to fit over one of your power rack's safety bars and freely rotate. 1 radiator hose clamp 1 carabiner clip or similar style "quick release" fastener about six feet of poly or nylon braided rope These materials may be easily purchased at your local hardware store or home improvement center for less than ten dollars. Follow the link for a thread on this piece of equipment, construction details and photos. Byron describes how to make your own wrist roller in this blog post.

 Homemade Sled
----------------------------------------------
 Sled pulling was a featured activity at the recent "Mini-Bash"... here are some "wild-eyed" musings on the equipment: Since I'm too che... er, uh, FRUGAL to drop $100 - $200 on a pulling sled, I naturally sought about examining alternatives to the purchase of a pulling sled. One idea is to take the metal bed of a children's wagon. Remove the wheels and all associated hardware, attach an "eye" bolt to the front and pile plates into it. Similar to that is the use of the metal or plastic pan of a wheelbarrow. Remove the staves and wheel, attach the "eye" bolt approximately midway on the slanted front surface, load 'er up and pull away. Finally, if most of your pulling is going to be on pavement or a similar hard surface, take an old tire and drill through the tread, to attach the "eye" bolt. Fit a circular or square piece of plywood into the tire, so that the plates won't fall through...a loading post isn't 100 percent necessary but it is nice. This is probably the cheapest sled of all and you have a nasty "friction factor" to overcome as well. (It will really tear up loose dirt and grass, though.) Poly rope, nylon straps or maybe even a water skiing tow rope and you're good to go. More on the cheap sled discussion is here, and the wiki sled pulling page is here.

 Slosh Pipe
----------------------------------------------
 Byron's instructions for making a slosh pipe: 10' stick of 4" PVC pipe, schedule 40 type one 4" plain cap one 4" threaded plug cap PVC cement (there are different types, two part type with primer and cement is common - read the lables when you buy to make sure!) optional - thread sealant, strap wrench Glue the caps on, following the instructions on the can; fill it 2/3 to 3/4 - maybe a little thread sealant on the threads to keep water from dripping around the threads. The thread sealant you want is just like a grease, not a glue that hardens when it dries - again, look at the label when you buy.    ''Make sure you build you slosh pipe out of 4" PVC Sched 40 pipe rather than 4" PVC landscape drainage pipe. The former is quite a bit sturdier than the latter. I went with the landscape pipe because I couldn't find the sched 40 and it has deformed significantly due to the weight of the water. It also deforms when you squeeze it...Kit''** And for a wilder ride, click on over to Straighttothebar.com for an ADJUSTABLE slosh pipe. Good grief!

 One-Hand Deadlift Handle
----------------------------------------------
 A special set up for one hand deads is nice but not absolutely necessary. Lately, I've been doing my deads with an exercise bar (non-revolving, so they're a tad easier on the grip.) It is imperative that your grip be centered on the bar and that the movement be done slowly enough so as to not introduce any unnecessary movement to the bar. The difficulty in stabiilizing the bar adds to the grip work. I do them with the bar in front like a conventional dead, with the off hand braced on the thigh and providing some power. I squat down to the weight, so the emphasis is mostly on the legs. You can make a set up similar to mine for about $20. Requires a cable handle (Play It Again Sports - about $12,) a long threaded eyebolt, nut and a LARGE fender washer, (about $6) and a carabiner clip or an "O" fitting (about $1-2) If you use Olympic plates, you'll need a 1 1/4 lb. plate also to bridge the large hole in the Olympic plates.

 Calf Raise Yoke
----------------------------------------------
 I was influenced by pictures in the Rader Master Bodybuilding and Weight Gaining Course by Peary Rader. They used to do standing calf work by backing up to what they called the "sliding post" which looked like a long piece of 2x6 that was anchored at a very slight angle to the floor and wall. Then they would simply lean back against the 2x6 and slide up and down against it. Did the same thing for certain types of squats, also. Here's another idea I have worked on for a calf machine. Take the safety bars for your rack and insert one at just above shoulder level. The other goes just above knee level (both on the same side, of course.) Take two pieces of 2x4 that you've drilled a pivot hole through near one end. Fasten these two pieces together with a sturdy crossbar arrangement. (should look like a big "H.") A suitable hook is affixed to the crossbar. Thread this assembly on your top safety bar...dig? This is your yoke. The bottom safety bar uses a doubled length of 2x4 with a hole drilled near each end. One hole is the pivot hole, the other is for the weight holder bar. Dig? Near the weight holder bar is a suitable hook. Thread this on the lower safety bar. A length of chain travels from the top hook arrangement to the bottom hook arrangement. Weights are mounted on the bar and this basically creates a leverage bar for the machine. Dig? Adjust the chain length to suit, shoulder the yoke (suitably padded of course) and do your calf raises. A step up from using the rack to slide against, you've now created the poor man's standing calf machine. Might cost all of twenty dollars.

 Weighted Dipping Belt
----------------------------------------------
 Make your own dipping belt...here's the patented, Wicked Willie Cheap Bas..er, uh frugal Person way: Get an old hand towel or small bath towel. Tie a length of cotton clothesline rope on one end. Pass the rope through the barbell plate(s) and tie to the other end of the towel, adjusting the length so that the towel hangs comfortably off your hips, resting centered in your lower back. This will work just as well as a commercial unit...for a short while. Eventually, the sharp edge of the plate(s) hole will cut through the rope. If you have a lifting belt, it's a simple matter to buy some chain at Wal Mart and a clip or two to suspend weights from. Here's more of that discussion. A Poor Man's Hip Belt  by Wicked Willie Currently, I'm using a homemade hip belt that consists of the following: A leather weightlifting belt Two equal lengths of chain Two snap boat clips (mine were rated for 350 pounds) Two nylon bushings, two carriage bolts, 6 fender washers and 2 regular washers and two lock washers and nuts Here's how it's assembled.  While wearing the belt so that it fit snugly just above my hips, (not at the waist) I marked a point on each side, in line with my hip.  I then drilled a 1/2 inch hole at each mark.  I fit the nylon bushing in this hole.  Taking one of the bolts and hardware...I assembled it in this order:  First a regular washer, then the end link of the chain, then a fender washer.  I pushed the end of the bolt through the belt and the bushing from the inside.  On the outside, I placed a fender washer, the loop from the boat snap clip, another fender washer, a lock washer and finally, the nut.  Then I tightened everything down till the lock washer was compressed.  I repeated this assembly on the other side. Here's what it should look like and how it's used.  When wearing the belt, you should have a length of chain dangling from the inside of the belt.  You thread barbell plates onto the chain and then hook a link in the boat snap clip (which is on the outside of the belt.)  You should have plates hanging from the chain, which is attached to both sides of the belt, stressing it equally so that the belt doesn't fold over from the weight.  Load your left and right side equally, grasp a sturdy upright and squat, while maintaining a very erect posture.  You may stand on cinder blocks or benches if you need the height to get sufficient depth, without the plates hitting the floor.  With a little work, it is possible to hang the weights at a length which will contact the floor when you reach your desired depth.  When the going gets heavy, you'll want to pad underneath the belt with a folded towel. You can do them in any style that you wish. By leaning back, keeping the knees wide and going so deep that you come up on the toes...all of these factors serve to decrease the contribution of the gluteus group and to place the stress on the lower quads and vastus groups. Alternate between flat footed and other styles, occasionally. IronMind's belt is nearly one hundred dollars with shipping.  Mine cost just under thirty nine dollars.  (Cheap is good!)  So far, it has worked well and allows for reasonably fast plate changes. Pull Up Bar Here's how to build that much-needed pullup bar.

 Poor Man's Reverse Hyper Bench/Spider Rowing Bench
----------------------------------------------
 Materials needed: Power Rack 1 8-10 ft. 2x6 3 1"x2" stringers 12 inches long or metal stock 4 1 1/4 inch two hole conduit strapping fittings 8 1 inch long 1/4" lag screws 10-12 drywall screws 1 5/8 inches long My power rack is about 44 inches between the uprights. I purchased an 8 ft. piece of 2 X 6 and had it cut in half when I purchased it. Placing the two pieces side by side, you now have a platform that is a little less than 12 inches wide...by about 1/4 to 1/2 inch. Secure the two pieces together using the wood stringers or metal strapping and drywall screws. Now place this assembly in your power rack, resting on the pins , evenly spaced. Mark this location. On the bottom side of the platform (stringer side) mount two of the U shaped conduit straps using the lag screws, at each end of the platform where you marked the pin location. (Your rack pins will pass through these and prevent the platform from moving.) Determine the height that you will use and place the pins at that level, passing them underneath the platform and through the conduit strapping. You should have a nice, strong platform that evenly spans the pins and uprights of your power rack, now. You can do hypers or reverse hypers off this...pad the contact points with an old pillow, blanket, rug or what have you. Some strapping or rope can secure your feet for hypers...none is necessary for reverse hypers, just hold unto the sides of the platform. You can also lay on the length of the platform and do dumbbell or barbell rows. I haven't weight tested mine yet, but it was easily able to support me while I jumped up and down on it and I weigh just a tad over 200 pounds. I already had some drywall screws and the wood for the stringers...so my total materials bill for this attachment was $6.70 from Lowe's Home Improvement. Assembly time was about twenty minutes or so...spent most of the time trying to find appropriate tools.

 Deadlift Blocks
----------------------------------------------
 As in the old Roger Eell's Chest Expanding course...I built a deadlift "hopper," per the diagram Eell copied from Joseph C. Hise. Off the top of my head, I think the dimensions and materials were as follows: 4 4 foot lengths of 2x8 2 54 inch lengths of 2x4 8 6-7 inch carriage bolts washers and nuts Lay two pieces of 2x8 on top of each other, to form a plank roughly 4 inches thick and 48 inches long. Do the same with the other two. Place these two planks so that 36 inches separates them, at their inside edges. (or the space between your Olympic bar inside collars. You may even wish to load your bar with some plates and then mark where the center point of the plate stack is) Lay the two 2x4s across these planks, one at each end, so that the edge of the 2x4 and the ends of the planks are flush. Now, carefully drill through the 2x4 and the planks, making two evenly spaced holes at each end, for a total of eight holes. Insert the bolts, washers and nuts and tighten everything together. (you may wish to counter sink the hardware) Turn the whole assembly over, so that the 2x4's are on the bottom. The raised 2x8s form a deadlifting platform that has some "spring" to it, since it can flex slightly from resting on the 2x4s. Since you're starting nearly six inches higher, you can use heavier weight. The spring of the platform prevents the "jarring" that is common in the power rach. It also is much kinder to your floors. As my wise friend Dan Martin said, the harmonics are entirely different from what you experience in the rack. If you really want something different, check out this article for a hopper deadlift apparatus using old wheels and tires. I'm a happy, frugal camper....

 Gym Rings
----------------------------------------------
 After a recent thread discussing (in part) ring training, Jim C writes, "gym rings can be very easily made from 1" PVC pipe. I heated a couple 26-inch lengths in the oven for 5-minutes at 350 F, then wrapped them around 8-inch diameter iron weight plates (10 pounders). They are cheap and sweet."

 Another Homemade Power Rack
----------------------------------------------
 Recently, Plate Loader of the IOL posted pictures of his homemade power cage that was constructed of wood.  His was a pretty creative solution that was simple to build and didn't cost a lot - less than $100.  (I imagine it could be built for even less with salvaged lumber - Wicked)  Here is a picture of the rack and of the dipping bar attachment: Here's what Plate Loader had to say about its construction: "I made this one out of wood until I could get a commercial rack. It worked so well I ended up keeping it there. I had 465 lbs. across the supports with no creaks or squeaks. The whole thing set me back about $95-$100. It's 2x6s, black 1" pipe and all 1/2" hardware. The pipe is used for chin bar, dip bars and plate holders etc. The removeable supports attached with big wing nuts. The 2nd photo is a close up of the dip bar attachment. You can see the smaller upper supports for squats or overhead presses. Crude but strong - and CHEAP."

 Step-up box
----------------------------------------------
 Many if not all of the Home Depot-type places have a panel saw for cutting plywood. In my experience, if you go when it isn't too busy, it's free with a little gratuity. This will do it in nine cuts off a sheet of 3/4" plywood, which with their panel saw will take about five minutes. For those of over 30" inseam: First cut - 12.5"x4' strip Second cut - 18"x4' strip Cut the first srtip into three pieces, 15.25", 15.25", and 17.25" Cut the second strip into three pieces, 12.5", 16", and 16" Trim 3/4" off the 12.5"x18" piece so it's 12.5"x17.25" This will make a 14"x16"x18" box from a half sheet of plywood. For those of less than 30" inseam: First cut - 10"x4' strip Second cut - 14"x4' strip Cut the first strip into three pieces, 13.25", 15.25", and 15.25" Cut the second strip into three, 10", 16", and 16" One extra cut: Trim 3/4" off the 10"x14" piece so it's 10"x13.25" This will make a 11.5"x14"x16" box and takes just a 2'x4' sheet. Glue and screw the piece together, and if you're going to put heavy weight on it, reinforce the joints with some scraps of 2"x2" or something for extra strength. Mike (Plateloader) adds another option: Cut some 1x8 or 1x10 boards to 24" lengths. Drill a hole about an inch in on each end in the same spot. Stack the 24" boards until the height is right. When you stack them up the holes should line up. Cut a dowel to length and slide it through the holes to keep the boards from sliding apart. When you progress, stack a couple of more on top - or if need be take a couple off to lower the height. Three 8-foot boards will give you 18" of height (twelve 24" pieces stacked). They'll cut them for you at Home Depot. Versatile, adjustable.

 Concrete Tire
----------------------------------------------
 From Vince over at Vince's Muscle Shop we get easy instructions on how to make a tire filled with concrete for heavy carries. You don't need the big drill - you can get a cheap 3" hole saw for a regular 3/8" drill. The rubber will grab at the bit, so don't let it torque your arm. A 16" knobby tire would work well and would be over 200. You can also just lay the tire flat and fill up one side of the wheel with concrete. If you are really clever, you could 1/2" x 3" bolts through the lug holes cast into the concrete so the center piece can be removed. You would probably have to lay some padding in first so the concrete does not bond to the steel.

 Vince's Sumo deadlift shin gliders
----------------------------------------------
 Vince writes: I made some 3 inch PVC Sumo rollers which made the lift much more efficient. I have been using the correct form for the Sumo, scraping up my shins like all the Westside guys. But scraped shins are not the goal of the lift, just the result. I used my power chop saw to cut 2 pieces of standard 3 inch schedule 20 Home-Depot type PVC pipe to 12-1/2". Then I slipped the PVC over the inside collars of the Olympic bar and moved them out against these collars. With my legs out in the wide Sumo stance the pipe rolls right up my shins. For standard deadlifts I slid the PVC over the inside collars and against the 45's which made the distance between them about 4 inches wider, enough to spread my hands to the outside of my knees.

 The Big Three
----------------------------------------------
 This workout concept was heavily promoted by Bill Starr in his book "The Strongest Shall Survive" subtitled "Strength Training For Football." It involves choosing a compound movement for pushing, pulling and the legs/hips.  Starr's "Big Three" mentioned in the book are the bench press, power clean and the squat.  These movements are worked using a 5x5 set/rep scheme.  After a general warmup that should see you breaking a light sweat, you perform the movements for five sets of five in the following manner: The first two sets are progressively heavier sets and serve as a further extension of your warm up.  The remaining three sets are done with the most weight you can handle (in very good form, of course!) for five reps.  The last set should be hard enough that initially, you should only be able to complete 4 reps.  When you can easily complete all five sets for five or six reps, add a small amount of weight and begin again. The combinations that this concept allows should provide training variety for quite some time.  For example:

 Starr's Classic
----------------------------------------------
 Bench Press/ Power Clean/ Squat

 My current preference
----------------------------------------------
 Clean and Press/ Power Clean/ Hip Belt Squat

 Other combinations
----------------------------------------------
 Overhead Press/  Bent Over Rows/  Squats Bradford Press/ High Pulls/ Front Squat Push Press/ Power Cleans/ Straddle Lift Dips/ Pullups/ Squats Power Cleans/ Front Squats/ Overhead Presses You are only limited by your own creativity.  Using dumbbells for the upper body work, whether using one or both hands, allows even more variety.  This workout is fast, requires a minimum of equipment and works the entire body.  Occasionally, it would be a good idea to include leg curls or some type of lower back/hamstring type movement, just to ensure that an adequate strength/muscle balance is maintained in the legs. Higher reps can be done, if using this concept as an abbreviated routine when bodybuilding. -Wicked Willie We discussed The Strongest Shall Survive in detail here. Here's another breakdown of Starr's 5x5 workout for intermediate lifters, and for advanced lifters. A simple version of the 5x5 is here.

 And now for a sample workout from Wicked Willie

 You want to initially choose movements that will engage as much of your muscle mass at once (compound movements) so that your workouts will be efficient. You also want to get the most "bang for your buck," so to speak. You want your workout to be simple, short and hard enough to stimulate growth. Don't worry too much right now about direct movements for your abdominals...just get into the workout habit, by not missing a workout for three months, if you can manage that. Concentrate on building muscle and the fat will be used for energy and replaced by muscle (provided your diet allows this...and it looked good.) Here's a thought on the workout...see how you like it. Requires a minimum of equipment and time. Warm up - 15 minutes of walking, while swinging your arms around in various ways. Call it GONZO power walking. You should break a light sweat. Or you can use a stationary bike...the idea is to heat up your core temperature and stimulate overall circulation and synovial fluid in the joints Squat 3x10 to at least parallel depth.When you can do 3x12 in good form...increase the weight. If you can't squat with weight, do them without weights. If for some reason, you are mechanically unable to squat...you may substitute the leg press. But seriously work at the squat before giving up...it is that important. Overhead Press 4x6 When you can do 4x8 in good form, increase. Dumbbell Row 4x8 When you can do 4x10... You may occasionally substitute the Lat Pulldown, your choice of grip and grip width. Deadlift 6x4Reset for each rep...DO NOT use a touch and go style. Do these moderately for back integrity...don't push hard on them until you've lost some weight and gained conditioning. Cool down 5-10 minutes of walking or stationary bike at a slower pace. That's your workout blueprint...it shouldn't take more than 45 minutes, minus the warm up. Once a week, just to satisfy your ego and desire...add some curls and triceps pushdowns or some type of curl and tricep work. THIS IS OPTIONAL...the basic blueprint is NOT OPTIONAL. Do this moderately also, just for pump and a good feeling. Once you've lost some weight and gained some conditioning, you can add isolation type stuff if you wish...but if you use the basics outlined here, you won't really need to use them. It's better to leave a workout feeling you could have done more, than it is to leave exhausted. Train, don't strain.

 One thing about limited equipment at home, there are a few exercises that are hard to do. We makeshift all the time, but I recently came across a simple tool that provides a lot of options for bodyweight exercises: a pair of mobile but stable dipping bars called the Lebert Equalizer. Here's a quick video of Mark, the designer, running through a variety of exercise possibilities; here's the same guy doing some playful and extremely difficult over and unders. Another trip over to You Tube will get you running woman, what looks to be an pretty intense gut effort, leg up vertical rows,  and an example of circuit training using the Lebert bars. You'll find a listing of some of the exercises you can do with the Equalizers here,, and this pdf  combines the suggestions and photos into a simple, printable format. At $99 ($117 including freight) for a pair of bars that you can do a whole slew of exercises with, that price is not too bad. Some of you can make your own, I'm sure, but when you get done, will they work that well and be a lot cheaper? I'm not so sure.

  I sure like the feeling Scott Bird, writing in his blog training journal, portrays: "Weight training in a home gym, using mostly free weights, has never felt like a short term thing. Unlike going to a commercial gym, training never feels like a chore; in fact I look forward to it." Here's his home gym setup guide. Now that you're salivating, here are some thoughts of how to set up a home gym, what equipment you might need, and a some tips on how to mentally switch from a commercial to a home gym.    Two schools of thought regarding home gym equipment For lack of better terms, let's call these two concepts minimalist and lavish.  The longer I have been involved in training, the more I tend to gravitate toward the minimalist approach.  Having the minimum amount of equipment doesn't require lots of space and it allows you to purchase top quality in the equipment that you do use.  My ideal minimalist approach would have the following: A lifting platform, either 8x8 or 12x12 feetA power cage A good quality barbell, at least 6 feet long and dumbbell handlesA heavy duty flat bench At least 300 lbs. of plates to start...minimum.  500 would be better and 1000 even better. This setup would allow Olympic lifting or Power lifting, as well as bodybuilding type movements.  The emphasis is on "platform lifting," simple, clean, "stand on your two feet and get it done."  The use of mainly standing exercises on the platform guarantees a strong midsection and practical, useable strength.  It also forces you to exercise your creativity when working out. The lavish approach would start with the above equipment and the sky would be the limit.  I'd add to this with a lat machine, hyperextension/roman chair unit, Hip belt squat set up or similar leg set up, numerous solid dumbbells and rack,  chin/dip unit or attachments for rack and some grip toys, including a thick bar. The up side of the lavish approach is that boredom is kept at bay, plus the substantial cash outlay for the extra equipment tends to motivate you to use it.  It is easier to work around injuries with various types of equipment available.  Obviously, there are two major negatives - the need for substantially more space and the expense.  Also, many machines actually make the movement easier...not necessarily a good thing.  The idea is to make a movement harder and potentially more productive. My current gym is in my garage and has a fair blending of the two thoughts above.  I have a power cage, lat machine and various handles, a leg extension/curl bench, flat bench, rack with a fair selection of hex dumbbells, plate holders and about 1000 lbs. of plates, a plate loading grip machine and CoC grippers and a few other grip toys.  I've just completed a hip squat belt.  Lately, the leg extension bench and flat bench are seeing little use.  As I say, I'm gravitating toward the minimalist approach.  Wicked  Willie Here's how to build that much-needed pullup bar. Now one thing you'll need: Fred Fornicola and Matt Brzycki's new book, Dumbbell Training for Strength and Fitness. Dan John wrote a one-dumbbell workout article for T-Nation; you can get an excellent workout with minimal equipment. Ironmind offers two informative articles on home gym equipment: Choosing a barbell set Choosing the right bar    Choosing a barbell set    Choosing the right bar In this article Dave Tate over at Elite writes of his dream gym, then hones it down for price.

 Hugo Rivera, about.com's Bodybuilding Guide, wrote two important pregnancy training articles for us. First, get yourself to the gym because you'll enjoy these benefits: 1) Speedier recovery after delivery 2) Increased sense of well being and self esteem during and after pregnancy 3) Less leg cramps 4) Larger placenta which in turn provides an increased nutrient base for the baby 5) Decrease the risk of excessive weight gain caused by an increase of fat storage 6) Stronger lower back which in turn reduces the risk of lower back pains 7) Boost in energy levels 8) Decrease the likelihood of varicose veins 9) Reduced chances of having a Caesarean birth 10) Higher chances of achieving labor either a few days earlier or on time 11) Exercise helps prepare the body for the stresses imposed by labor and delivery Here's the full article, including important pregnancy training tips and a training routine for pregnant women.    Sam Tsang adds: Memory of my wife's struggles are still fresh on my mind. One thing I know: My wife struggled with is her wrists for carrying the baby in sometime awkward positions. Do a lot of grip work, but also do a lot of wrist curls. Hugo also provided us a nutrition guide for pregnant women: Nutrition becomes even more important than ever before during these 9 months. You health and that of your baby depend on it. Do you know that the following conditions are caused by a lack of good nutrition during pregnancy? 1) Anemia (which is caused by lack of protein and vitamins in the diet) 2) Miscarriage 3) Babies born with brain damage, low intelligence, below average birth weight, and low immune systems 4) The afterbirth can break loose in the uterus before labor begins, a condition that causes internal bleeding in the mother and can cause the death of the baby (50% of the babies die) 5) Metabolic Toxemia (disease caused by lack of protein and vitamins) which can cause death to both the mother and the baby Here's the rest of his pregancy nutrition report. One of the first places we turn when looking for the female guide to training is Mistress Krista, who offers this comprehensive guide to training while pregnant. Now what? The baby's here, everybody's healthy, but you have to get yourself back to the gym. Mistress Krista offers this overview and suggested routine for post-partum training, including a photo guide.

  Coach Paul Smith under Dave's top squat

 That's a top squat? What's it do??
----------------------------------------------
 It's handles, really -- Simply a way to get your arms in front of you while squatting with an Olympic bar, which is particularly important if you have a shoulder injury, tightness or just want to prevent problems. And by getting your arms in front, your squat form improves instantly, like magic. The Top Squat site will give you Dave's thoughts on the unit, pricing and such, but here in the wiki we've collected the various top squat threads from the Iron Online forum as follows:    Top Squat thread one.    Top Squat thread two.    Top Squat thread three.    Top Squat thread four.    Top Squat thread five.    Top Squat thread six.    Top Squat thread seven.    Top Squat thread eight.    Top Squat thread nine.
